      <h2>Project Objective</h2>
      <p>
        This platform exists to help engineers save time by focusing on the key design
        principles rather than long theory. It provides structured explanations, diagrams,
        and practical reasoning so core concepts can be understood quickly without reading
        the entire book.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Time‑saving summaries centered on essential principles</li>
        <li>Clear, structured explanations with diagrams</li>
        <li>Practical reasoning to connect ideas to real software design</li>
